# FAQ – Troubleshooting DocWeaver

## ⚙️ Why won’t my Mermaid diagrams render on GitHub?
Make sure you’ve used three backticks (```) with `mermaid` on the **same line**, and no extra fences around it.

## 🧱 My `config.yml` variables aren’t resolving.
DocWeaver is a *conceptual* example project—variable resolution is shown for structure only, not executed.

## 🧩 Why are some badges static?
Badges are decorative placeholders. In a production version, they would be connected to GitHub Actions workflows.

## 🧭 Can I reuse these templates in my own repo?
Yes. All materials are licensed under MIT; attribution is appreciated.

## 🔒 Why is there no executable code?
DocWeaver focuses on documentation architecture and process, not a functioning parser.
