# Style Guide

## Voice & Tone
- Clear, direct, polite. Prefer present tense and active voice.
- Avoid marketing fluff. Define acronyms on first use.

## Formatting
- Use sentence case for headings.
- Limit sections to 5–7 bullets.
- Code fences: specify language (```bash, ```json, ```yaml).

## Examples
- Provide a minimal “happy path” first.
- Show one realistic error with a fix.

## Terminology
- Use “project” (not “app” or “tool”) consistently.
